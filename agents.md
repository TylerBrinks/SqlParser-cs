# AgentWatch - Agent Instructions

> **Note**: This project uses `CLAUDE.md` as the primary source of truth for AI coding agent instructions.

## For All AI Coding Tools

Please refer to **`CLAUDE.md`** for complete project documentation, including:

- Project overview and architecture
- Essential commands (build, test, database, development)
- Repository structure
- Domain-specific terminology
- Coding standards (C# and React best practices)
- Important warnings and gotchas
- Common development workflows
- Configuration details

## Why CLAUDE.md?

This project primarily uses Claude Code, so we maintain `CLAUDE.md` as the canonical documentation file. The contents are fully compatible with other AI coding tools (Cursor, Codex, Zed, etc.).
